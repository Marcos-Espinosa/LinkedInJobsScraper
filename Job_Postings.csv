About Us

DNA has captured the human imagination for over a century. From Mendel’s experiments with pea plants, to Rosalind Franklin’s discovery of the now-famous double helix structure of DNA to the human genome project — and the decoding of the complete human genome in 2022 — the field of genomics has seen some of the most significant milestone events in all of biology.




Nucleus is a natural extension of this evolution. We are a next-generation consumer genetic testing and analysis company, with whole-genome sequencing as our foundation. Nucleus combines rare variant analysis alongside polygenic scoring, to provide the most complete disease and trait disposition analysis that has ever been available in either a consumer or clinical setting.




The drop in sequencing price (from $1 billion in 2001 to well below $1,000 today) is a platform shift akin to the personal computer. We see a world where there’s a human genome on every smartphone, and the name of the app that manages, interprets, and contextualizes someone’s whole genome data is Nucleus. Nucleus is also actively working on leveraging health and wellness tools to provide hyper-targeted action steps based on people’s results.




In doing so, our ambition is to finally utilize the best of software, genomics data, and healthcare to shift from a reactive system that tends to the sick to a proactive one that prevents illness. After having experienced too many loved ones die before their time, we see a world where no one dies from a preventable disease.




Our ambitions are bold, we are fearless, and we believe that this era of precision healthcare — with genomics data at the foundation — is both imminent and inevitable. The question is not whether this brave new world will be built, but who will build it.




Join us.




Our Mission

Nucleus is redefining DTC genetic testing. By combining polygenic scores with traditional rare variant DNA analysis, the company provides comprehensive assessments of genetic disposition across a myriad of diseases and traits. Nucleus’ mission is to empower people to take agency over their health so no one dies from preventable disease -- that’s why the company is building a platform based on cutting-edge science, where everyone has their genome in their pocket, complete clarity on their risks, and are empowered by personalized health measures. Nucleus is also bridging the gap between people, doctors, and scientists to help discoveries, therapies, and cures find their way to people faster. Learn more at mynucleus.com.

Technology: Alexis Ohanian (Founder Reddit + 776), Founders Fund, Austen Allred (CEO, Bloom Institute of Technology), Matteo (CEO, Eight Sleep)

Technical webinars: Before the course begins on October 10th, we’ll offer intro sessions, covering key topics that we’ll cover in more detail during the training. Examples include sessions on; Notepad, Github and HTML.
Inspirational women speaker series: Get insights and advice from women who’ve worked in technology and the corporate world for decades. One of the sessions will feature Su Morton, Managing Director at State Street.
Career readiness support: Put your best foot forward by learning how to write a killer CV and ace those all-important interviews.




Get your foot in the door at a leading employer




During and after the training, you’ll have access to job opportunities via our graduate program.

We work with the biggest names in banking, technology, and insurance. We help them find driven graduates who are custom-trained in the skills they need. If you’re successfully placed, you’ll begin a 12-24 month placement with the client as a Wiley Edge employee. At the end of the placement, the majority convert to full time employees with the organization. If you’d prefer to complete the training and start your career elsewhere, that’s not a problem. We don’t make you sign any unfair contracts and you’ll never have to pay a thing.




We Aspire for greater diversity in tech

It's no secret, the tech industry needs more diversity. The standard entry requirements for tech graduate roles can act as a barrier, preventing people with potential from getting the start they deserve. As a training and careers provider, we asked ourselves, what can we do to help more women start careers in tech?




‘Aspire’ is a training course specifically for women, taught by women. The program has been designed to encourage more women to participate in technology roles and to help solve the issue of low representation in the industry.

Security Clearance

This position does not currently require a Department of Energy (DOE) security clearance.

Sandia will conduct a pre-employment drug test and background review that includes checks of personal references, credit, law enforcement records, and employment/education verifications. Furthermore, employees in New Mexico need to pass a U.S. Air Force background screen for access to Kirtland Air Force Base. Substance abuse or illegal drug use, falsification of information, criminal activity, serious misconduct or other indicators of untrustworthiness can cause access to be denied or terminated, resulting in the inability to perform the duties assigned and subsequent termination of employment.

If hired without a clearance and it subsequently becomes necessary to obtain and maintain one for the position, or you bid on positions that require a clearance, a pre-processing background review may be conducted prior to a required federal background investigation. Applicants for a DOE security clearance need to be U.S. citizens. If you hold more than one citizenship (i.e., of the U.S. and another country), your ability to obtain a security clearance may be impacted.

Members of the workforce (MOWs) hired at Sandia who require uncleared access for greater than 179 days during their employment, are required to go through the Uncleared Personal Identity Verification (UPIV) process. Access includes physical and/or cyber (logical) access, as well as remote access to any NNSA information technology (IT) systems. UPIV requirements are not applicable to individuals who require a DOE personnel security clearance for the performance of their SNL employment or to foreign nationals. The UPIV process will include the completion of a USAccess Enrollment, SF-85 (Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions) and OF-306 (Declaration of for Federal Employment). An unfavorable UPIV determination will result in immediate retrieval of the SNL issued badge, removal of cyber (logical) access and/or removal from SNL subcontract. All MOWs may appeal the unfavorable UPIV determination to DOE/NNSA immediately. If the appeal is unsuccessful, the MOW may try to go through the UPIV process one year after the decision date.

The result is a company in which every member feels valued and where ideas flow freely. If you can respect that, you have a place here.

Building Satisfaction

When people love their jobs, they do great work. So when one of our employees feels that an alternate career direction would bring them more challenge, fulfillment, or joy, we encourage it with training to help them get there. The same is true if a position comes up that we think would be good for you. We’ll suggest it and see what you think. Even if you’re happy exactly where you are, our McKinstry University gives you the chance to take classes that can help you be more productive or learn about virtually any facet of our business. No wonder that when McKinstry people want to move ahead in their career, they don’t leave… they stay!
