You would get to work with a wide range for exciting tools to find pragmatic solutions to challenging real-world problems. You would be able to leverage what you already know while having the opportunity to learn new things constantly.

While we are a start-up with a lot of work to do, we also value work-life balance. Our goal is to provide you with a challenging work environment where you are learning new things every day, but where you also maintain normal hours.

And it inspires us to be the safest and best place for cancer care – to bring greater hope to every patient we serve. It’s why we’ve been continually named One of the Top Places to Work in the Tampa Bay Area. As the only National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center based in Florida, Moffitt employs some of the best and brightest minds from around the world. Moffitt is the leading cancer hospital in both Florida and the Southeast and has been nationally ranked by U.S. News & World Report since 1999. Because working at Moffitt is both a career and a mission: to contribute to the prevention and cure of cancer. Join a dedicated, diverse and inclusive team of over 7,000 to be a part of the Courageous future we envision.




Summary




The Data Scientist III (DS) will work directly with key stakeholders throughout Moffitt to document data-related needs and identify novel approaches, including advanced data science and analytics techniques, for addressing those needs. This position is remote but based in Florida.




The DS will incorporate these novel approaches into the larger Health Data Services and Digital Innovation strategies. The DS will liaise directly with both clinical and research faculty whose work is focused on genomics, radiomics, immunooncology, evolutionary therapy, patient-reported outcomes, and other areas to ensure Moffitt’s analytics methods are best positioned to accelerate discovery using Moffitt’s vast data assets. Optimizing the use of Moffitt’s data assets requires careful considerations of data formatting, lineage, quality, linkages, and visualizations. As Moffitt continues to incorporate new data types into its cloud-based analytics platform, modern strategies for data provenance, ingestion, linkage, and dissemination will become even more critical for the ultimate realization of the value of these data across the Center. Innovative data types include, but are not limited to, medical record text, radiology and pathology images, molecular data, and patient-generated data (wearables).




The DS will implement Moffitt’s data and analytics strategy through the creation of predictive models and algorithms, manipulation of datasets to identify trends and extract meaningful knowledge, development of data mining solutions using natural language processing and machine learning to extract structured data, and more. Such work will not only have an immediate and high impact on clinical use cases, such as tumor boards, but also on cutting-edge research such as automation of tumor segmentation.




The Data Scientist III is a senior professional within the Data Scientist career path. The DS will receive little instruction on day-to-day work and general instructions on new projects or assignments. The DS will work on problems of diverse scope where analysis of data requires evaluation of identifiable factors. The DS will demonstrate good judgment in selecting methods and techniques for obtaining solutions. The DS will network with senior internal and external personnel. May be asked to mentor junior data scientists or on-board others.




The Ideal Candidate Will Have




A minimum of 5 years of experience in quantitative analytics and applied data science OR Master’s degree in a quantitative field and 3 years of experience in quantitative analytics and applied data science.
Strong proficiency programming in R, Python, or adjacent languages
Experience performing advanced statistical analysis or building a variety of machine learning models
